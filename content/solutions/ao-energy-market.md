      ### Easily test different scenarios and iterate quickly

      Queue up a wide variety of mass grid simulation scenarios and adjust parameters after the initial run to find the right configuration. Consultant-provided runs typically only include a few scenario views and revised scenarios come with additional multi-week timelines.

      ### View and edit modeling assumptions

      Consultant-led models use black box assumptions making it difficult for developers to understand what is being analyzed and adjust parameters as needed. We use an open modeling approach so you can clearly view and augment the assumptions to better align with your team's approach.
