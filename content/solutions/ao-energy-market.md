      ### Easily test  scenarios and iterate quickly

      AO Energy Markets' scenario analysis engine allows users to automatically queue thousands of modeling scenarios with just a few clicks. After initial runs, it's easy to adjust parameters and identify the best project configuration. Consultant-provided runs only include a handful of scenario views and revised runs often come with additional multi-week timelines.

      ### View and edit modeling assumptions

      Consultant-led models use black box assumptions making it difficult for developers to understand what is being analyzed and adjust parameters as needed. We use an open modeling approach so you can clearly view and augment the assumptions to better align with your team's approach.
