      ### Automate time-consuming environmental GIS analysis to quickly calculate buildability

      Finding potential parcels and evaluating parcel quality and buildability can be tedious and time-consuming with traditional GIS programs. AO Prospect helps users calculate buildable acreage and create constraint maps for each parcel with just a few clicks.

      * Quickly identify potential parcels based on substation or line radius and minimum acreage.
      * Calculate buildable area acreage and create hazard constraint maps.
      * Sort and filter parcels based on buildable area.
