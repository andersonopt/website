### Background

In late 2017, [Solar Power World](https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/) published an [article](https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2017/11/electric-cooperatives-community-solar/) discussing cooperatives and their integration of community solar. The article mentioned that one of the most difficult aspects of renewable projects is early-stage siting.

Given our expertise in this area, we agreed to write an article that would give readers a look at some of these challenges as well as some of the ways that developers are using software and GIS capabilities such as ours to address these difficulties. 

With that in mind, we welcome you to check out the article, and reach out with any other renewable siting questions.
