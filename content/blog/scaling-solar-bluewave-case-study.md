### Empowering a mission-based solar developer to increase their speed and scale

_Director of Site Acquisition Tyson R. Buerkle used Anderson Optimization to help his team at BlueWave move faster and more fully own the end-to-end siting process._

## **Challenge**

Market dynamics can rapidly change and developers often need to move fast to take advantage of new opportunities. When BlueWave identified some key siting opportunities in a new market, they needed a way to move forward quickly and scale their process.

“We received early indications that solar development opportunities would open up in Maine in 2019 which would align with our company’s strengths. We decided to acquire site control on 14 sites in the state before the end of the year.

##   
Solution

“Anderson Optimization provided us a single tool platform to filter through to our top priority sites, reach out to the landowners of these sites, and ensure that everyone who responded with interest owned a site that we wanted to develop.

We built a team and a process around originating our own sites. **We used/use Anderson to rapidly sift through existing land in our target areas and the software helps us get closer to automating the identification of high potential sites**. The tool also helps us maintain a methodical approach and minimizes doubling up on search areas.

We have always found the Anderson team immediately responsive to our questions, requests and needs. They seem genuinely enthused to create solutions that meet our business needs.”
