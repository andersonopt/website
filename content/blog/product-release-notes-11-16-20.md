# **Features and New Functionality**

## Tasks now under 'See Actions' button

Eventually these tasks will be available directly from a sidebar on the map, but as we work through the redesign, we've moved the tasks to the new 'See Actions' button.

* Go to the Parcels tab
* Click 'See Actions' 
* Tasks available include, Parcel Search, Create Combo Buffer, and Project Buildable Area Analysis

We have started a series of updates to the data tables across the platform. More changes to come soon!

* Added checkboxes for easier row selection.
* Updated the interface

## Easily view attribute data from multiple layers at once

When multiple layers are enabled on the map, the layer pop-up window now displays tabs for each layer. 

Click to the tab of interest to see more info about that layer.
