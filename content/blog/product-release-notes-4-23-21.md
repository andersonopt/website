# **Features and New Functionality**

## New Project View - Larger Map

Larger project map makes it easier to view all key details of a project in one view.

## Filter, Columns, and Export buttons have moved

As we continue to work through the redesign, some buttons have moved around/changed look: 

* Filter, Columns, and Export buttons are now above the asset table view (vs. on the side)

## New style editor and templates

More easily [create and save custom asset and drawing styles](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/advanced-tools/custom-style-assets-and-drawings "create and save custom asset and drawing styles") with the new style editor and template tool.

## Updated asset detail page

The new [asset detail page](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/advanced-tools/asset-detail-page "asset detail page") automatically opens as a new tab (and can be accessed from the asset pop up on any map or the asset list).

This will open the new asset detail page. On this page, users can edit details about an asset, save notes, etc.

## New US Nationwide Layers

### Updated Solar Resource/Irradiance Layers

We added more details versions of the previous Solar Resource Potential layers with more detailed versions of the layer from NREL's NSRDB Data Viewer:

\- Solar Resource - Multi Year PSM Direct Normal Irradiance  
\- Solar Resource - Multi Year PSM Global Horizontal Irradiance

### Township, Range, Section - PLSS Viewer

Locate land by township, range, and section with this new layer. Try switching to the 'Terrain' basemap setting for easier viewing of this layer if the source font is hard to see over the norma satellite basemap.
