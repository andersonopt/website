Check out what's new in Anderson Optimization's latest release (**v.X.X.XX**)

Make sure you're running the latest version of the app to see the updates

# Features and New Functionality

## View all parcel details in a single pop-up

No need to toggle the Parcels layer on and off to see all the detailed parcel info for any parcels you've already added to a project. Just expand the new details section to see all the info!

SCREENSHOT

## Project lists sorted from newest to oldest by default

Trying to find that project you recently created? New projects will appear at the top of the project list by default (_pro tip: double-click the header of any column in a data table to change the sort-order of the table to that that attribute_)

## 

# Fixes

* Fixed an issue where some distance measurements were defaulting to the wrong unit (km instead of mi)
