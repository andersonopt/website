# **New Features and Enhancements**

## Updated Buildable Area Analysis

### Save time with templates

Find yourself wanting to reuse the same settings and parameters for Buildable Area Analysis often? Now users can save time by saving preferred settings in [**templates**](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis/run-buildable-area-analysis/buildable-area-analysis-template) on the updated [**Buildable Area Analysis** form](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis)! Saved templates are currently available, editable, and deletable at the user-level (in a future update, we will make these available at the company-level).

To save a template, click inside the blank **Template** box in the lower right-hand corner of the **Project Buildable Area Analysis form** and enter **template name**. Click **Create:**

### New hazard/exclusion settings added in Project Buildable Area Analysis:

Four new settings for hazards and exclusions have been added, including:

* **Critical Habitats**
* **Public Lands** (Protected Areas Database)
* **Transmission Lines**
* **Oil and Gas Wells**

[**Critical Habitats**](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis/run-buildable-area-analysis#critical-habitats) and [**Public Lands**](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis/run-buildable-area-analysis#public-lands) hazard/exclusion settings can be found on the main **Buildable Area Analysis** settings view. To activate each, click the corresponding toggle + enter desired setbacks:

To see **Transmission Lines** and **Oil and Gas Wells** hazard exclusions, click the [**Infrastructure**](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis/run-buildable-area-analysis#infrastructure) toggle on the main **Buildable Area Analysis** settings view + input desired setbacks:

### Setback field changes

[Setback field at the top of the form](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/buildable-area-analysis/run-buildable-area-analysis#parcel-boundary-setback) now ONLY applies to the **internal parcel boundary setback**; this setback will no longer automatically apply as the default to other settings.

Constraint maps clipped to parcel boundary

Constraint maps are now ‘clipped’ to the parcel/site boundary to make it easier to see the parcel boundaries when constraint maps are displayed.
