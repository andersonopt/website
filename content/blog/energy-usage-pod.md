### Background

We recently had the opportunity to be interviewed for MarketScale's Energy Industry podcast. In this podcast, they talk to a variety of industry leaders about their respective fields of work to learn more.

Within this conversation, we cover a variety of energy industry and grid modernization topics. 

In addition to general grid and industry discussion, we give a glimpse into how we started the company and how we have evolved along the way. While we have always known that optimization modeling would be a core component of our business, our focus on the renewable development market as well as siting came about somewhat unexpectedly.  


We'll appreciate it if you give it a listen.
