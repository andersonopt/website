# **Features and New Functionality**

## Export Button

As part of the redesign, we've added a new ['Exports' button](https://docs.andersonopt.com/prospect/export-project-data "'Exports' button") with each of the export options listed in one place. Well almost...the PDF Report tool is still available under the map toolbar > menu > report. We'll be moving that to the new Export button as a later update.

## Improved Map Pop-Ups

Based on your feedback, we've made some changes so that pop-ups on the map are a bit more user-friendly. We added the additional functionality:

* Drag and drop pop-ups

* Close out all layer tabs in a pop-up window with a single click
* Moved trash can icon to main asset pop up menu
