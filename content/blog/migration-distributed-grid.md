### Background

In late 2017, we began discussions with the American Solar Energy Society ([ASES](https://www.ases.org/)) about developing an article series focused on the advancement of renewable energy and the implications of a 100% renewable grid.

ASES and we decided it would be valuable to provide a high-level overview of how renewables will proliferate moving forward, what a grid of the future looks like, difficulties that renewables create, the technologies that support renewable integration, and more. 

With that in mind, we welcome you to follow along in the series, and reach out with any questions.
