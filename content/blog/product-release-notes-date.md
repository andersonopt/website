# **Features and New Functionality**

We made a number of backend changes with this release that will continue to help us work towards the redesigned look and feel of the platform. We overhauled the map and updated quite a bit of code architecture. Not all the updates will be directly visible to users, but all of them help us build towards are larger redesign.

You may noticed some interface changes already, however, including: 

**Hidden sidebar/larger map:**

**More streamlined project creation flow:** In addition to these interface updates, we also worked on a few new features:

## Update Buildable Area(?)

## KML Export Settings

**Sub-folders for Hazards**

Exported KML files now group hazards into sub-folders based on the hazard type, so all slope polygons are in a sub-folder for slope. This makes it simple to toggle on and off entire hazard categories in Google Earth.

**Group hazards by owners and parcels**

In conjunction, we've added an additional setting to group layers by parcel. Use this setting if you want to easily hide/show individual parcels (and all their associated layers).

Fixes
