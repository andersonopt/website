## Our Purpose

We firmly believe it is necessary for society to adopt renewable energy and storage solutions to ensure a lasting energy future. Our mission is to help accelerate the adoption of these technologies by providing software and services that reduce inefficiencies and provide better analytical tools to help industry stakeholders expedite project timelines, lower costs and maximize returns.

## How We Got Here...

It all began in 2016 when Jake & Eric (yep, they’re related; cousins to be exact) teamed up to build a company that would deliver better power system modeling solutions to the energy industry. They knew there was a need for better tools after Eric spent years in the energy modeling industry and research community.

They spent months talking to industry participants learning about problems. They consistently heard about pain points related to renewable siting, which was a perfect initial use case on the way to their ultimate vision.

Since then, Anderson Optimization has grown rapidly. Our team is expanding. We’re working with many of the largest renewable developers, and we continue to build exciting solutions that drive value for our customers as we do our part to usher in a new energy future.
