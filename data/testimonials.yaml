  review: '"The AO desktop tool has provided immeasurable assistance in quickly identifying
    and narrowing down potential sites for new greenfield development by incorporating
    key development screening layers such as flood plains, wetlands, topography, bedrock,
    proximity to transmission lines/substations, etc.  The database is comprehensive
    and with a simple-to-use interface for setting up initial projects from a transmission
    line asset or land asset.  The comprehensive results have lead to making efficient
    decisions on where to start to look for key development sites by deploying all
    the available layers and tools. It has also assisted tremendously with evaluating
    third party acquisition targets during the due diligence phase and comparing results
    with critical issues analyses. AO is a very supportive partner and vendor as well
    -- they address any outstanding questions and technical issues promptly and professionally.
    AO keeps us constantly updated on their new features, and they are always looking
    to improve the software by adding layers and new features to facilitate a developer’s
    job in accessing good, constructible sites."'

  review: "“Everyone here is very impressed with the Anderson tool. We all watched
    Chris get set up in a matter of days and be ready to mail letters to potential
    landowners. He is out this week meeting all of the landowners he made contact
    with and we even have signed LOI’s already in the land bank!”\n"

  review: "“Our company started with one person using Anderson Optimization for site
    identification in one state. Within a few months, two more individuals requested
    access after seeing the platform's capabilities and our company added two more
    states. Our team has gone from using AO for site identification to incorporating
    it into our daily workflow of site analysis, as well as pulling parcel information
    for early-stage development activities.”\n"
