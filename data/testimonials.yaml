  review: "“Everyone here is very impressed with the Anderson tool. We all watched
    Chris get set up in a matter of days and be ready to mail letters to potential
    landowners. He is out this week meeting all of the landowners he made contact
    with and we even have signed LOI’s already in the land bank!”\n"

  review: "“Our company started with one person using Anderson Optimization for site
    identification in one state. Within a few months, two more individuals requested
    access after seeing the platform's capabilities and our company added two more
    states. Our team has gone from using AO for site identification to incorporating
    it into our daily workflow of site analysis, as well as pulling parcel information
    for early-stage development activities.”\n"
